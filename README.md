# Project Proposal
### Project title


SCURMaster

### What and why?

I want to incoporate the SCRUM framework in everyday life to help individuals achieve their goals. The goals could be 1) learn a new skill, 2)complete a project, and 3)build a habit, etc

SCRUMaster is a tracker that help you visualize your past (your program), the present (what you need to do right now) and your future (your general plan and what you will achieves also the your specific scheudle)

Everyone have the fear against uncertainty and I believe that is what procrastination mostly consist of, the fear against the unknown. SCRUMaster is here to help users deal with that. Instead of daily planners that users put in what they need to get done for the day, SCRUMaster start with a project.


Also, features like team project could be added that mutiple people could be working on the same project and check each other's progress.

Also to help with getting start easily on each task. Users could add a lot of information to each task including files that needed for that task. 

### For whom?

This will be for people who don't have a completely not changing schedule. Target users, college student who are looking to achieve the most with their time. 

### How?

 For example, if the user need to do write an essay based on some reading material. Then he would start a project on SCRUMaster and be the product owner of the writing assignment. And he need to list all the tasks needed to be done for this product. All the tasks have to be under a certain scall that the user is comfortable working on without any hesitation. Also, a expected finish time to get this project done. 
Then the project will look like:
Title: XXX essay \
parts: \
expected finish time: \
0 first go through the prompt \
1 read and anotate article 1 \
2 read and anotate article 2 \
3 think about the argument \
4 draft the essay outline \
5 fill in XXX paragraphs \
6 fill in XXX paragraphs \
7 fill in XXX paragraphs \
8 retouch the transition \
9 check grammer errors and polish \
10 Read through and last check
The user could also set a expected time to finish each tasks.
After this step is done, the user could add the tasks to his/her daily schedule.


### Scope

This is a relatively simple application.
Front end: there are limited number of UI interface need to be impletement.
Back end: there are limited interaction between users and we don't have to syncronizedly update the user data. Don't need a very large database.
